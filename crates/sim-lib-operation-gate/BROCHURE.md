# sim-lib-operation-gate

In one line: Domain-neutral capability and exact-approval gate for effectful SIM operations.

## What it gives you

A domain-neutral gate for content-identified operations. Callers provide the required capability, the exact operation request, and an approval bound to that request; mismatched, stale, missing, or over-broad authority fails closed before an effect adapter runs. Approval cannot silently drift to a different operation. Capability checks and human review remain separate, inspectable facts. Domain libraries reuse one gate instead of inventing approval policy. This runtime organ sits immediately before effectful adapters. It owns admission records and checks, never the effect itself. The contract keeps inputs, outputs, limits, and refusal cases explicit, so callers can compose the capability without acquiring unrelated host, transport, or product authority. Stable records make the result suitable for tests, inspection, and deterministic integration.

## Why you will be glad

- The public contract makes supported behavior, limits, and typed failures visible before integration.
- One owning crate prevents neighboring libraries from growing competing copies of the same policy.
- Deterministic records and checked tests keep adapters reviewable when implementations evolve.

## Where it fits

Within SIM, sim-lib-operation-gate owns only the focused contract described above. Adjacent runtime libraries, platform adapters, codecs, and user surfaces can build around it while retaining their own policy. That boundary keeps the kernel small, avoids competing implementations, and lets this capability evolve without forcing unrelated components to change.
